Even if it's ground based and uses carrier waves - distance between ground recivers 1 , 2 , 3, 4 is known (ie distance from reciver 1 to 2 , 1to3 and so forth for all is known ). If there is a carrier wave (if needed ) or multiple carrier waves broadcasted in all directions then when the elf is emitted from the body and interacts with the carrier wave and then goes to the reciver then it arrives at reciver 1 at time A and recivier 2 at time A+x same with recivier 3 and 4 - even if multiple carrier frequencies used the program can demodulate and then find out which wave is which by looking for the waves with the same phase and amplitude and frequency (and power if necessary) the system can figure out which wave is the same at all recivers  regardless of the extra time it took in pico to femptoseconds to get to each one by matching the properties . Since the distance between the receivers and known and the speed of light is known - the real time coordinate of the wave (where it originated from ) in the brain/the person can be known . 

Since the brain is emitting lots of these emf vlf type fields every square center meter (and these either go directly to the reciver or interact with the carrier wave and are demodulated by the reciver (assume demodulating between all recivers is standardized amount of time regardless of the carrier - and also assume there is no variance between detection capabilities of the recivers) -- since the brain is emitting lots of these emf vlf type fields then reciver A and b and c and d can identify the same wave based on the shared properties ie the same wave regardless of the time it took to reach each respective recivier will have the same phase , amplitude and frequency (after demodulation - even if different carrier  frequencies are used for the same wave -) and such it can be identified even if the time stamp for reciver A is (a) and the time stamp for reciver B is (a+x) and the time stamp for recivier C is (a+y) and since the location of all the recivers is known then the real time location of that wave originated from can be found . Then say another wave (wave two )that originates 1cm over in the brain goes through the same process - it will have a different amount of time to get to all three recivers - a new (a) , (a+x), and (a+y) different from the other wave (wave 1) even if it is a femptosecond or lower time frame. This means it's location can be found and it can be identified based on its unique properties as well (even if it is the same properties it will have a diffent time stamp ) - this process is repeated all over the brain - and a remote eeg can be done . 

Can also tell the diffrence between different people since even persons 1m apart will have different time stamps (also unique properties - but need the unique time stamps and thus location can be found ) . Allows the same cluster type analysis to be performed and persons can be differentiated from persons and brain regions across a brain can be differentiated by the unique electromagnetic signals over long distance 

and then by unique signal processing and neural networks one can do a remote eeg on a persons brain from very long distance and coorelate it to the real time visual field , auditory field , internal thoughts , nerve firing paterns , etc .
